Useful to teach about the coordinate systems of the canvas:
  parallel-lines.js: this is an optical illusion where two lines of equal lengths appear to have different lengths
  parallel-lines2.js: same as above with the lines moving

To introduce iteration and for loops:
  grid_illusion.js: a simple grid of white lines overlapping. When fixed at a point, some black dots seem to appear at the intersections of the lines
